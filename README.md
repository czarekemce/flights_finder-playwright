Flights finder, for which I used eSky app.

Because of the fact that using the eSky API is paid, like the other flight search apps I decided to use playwright.ts for this which searches flights by GUI.

In that case, I am looking for some flights to Tenerife Island within 25.09 - 15.10

To run, you need to type in the terminal:

npm install

npm run search

Then, all the prices should be in the ceny.txt file.
